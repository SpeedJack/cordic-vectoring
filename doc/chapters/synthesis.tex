\chapter{Synthesis}\label{ch:synthesis}

After the verification of the correctness of our VHDL model through \matlab{}
and \modelsim{} we can now proceed with the synthesis and implementation on the
\xilinx's \zybo{} Development Board using \vivado.

In this section we present the results of our synthesis in terms of resource
utilization, timing and power consumption.

Before to start the analysis of the results we want to clarify some assumption
we have to make in order to correctly understand them:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The results are obtained running first the \emph{synthesis}, then
		the \emph{implementation} on the board \zybomodel,
		using the default synthesis and strategy provided by \vivado*;
	\item The constraints file we have provided specifies only the desired
		clock frequency of \(125 MHz\), this frequency has been chosen
		without the purpose of a real implementation, just following the
		hints provided during laboratory lectures;
	\item The pin placement is completely left to \vivado*, no pin
		assignment has been provided before the implementation;
	\item The maximum clock frequency obtained has been computed supposing
		that, after the implementation, \vivado* has found the best
		solution possible using the default strategy.
\end{itemize}
