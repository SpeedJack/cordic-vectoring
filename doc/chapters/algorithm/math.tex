\section{Mathematical background}\label{sec:math}

Vector's rotation is the basis of \cordic{} algorithm. Let's suppose to have an
input vector \((x_0, y_0)\) and that we want to rotate it of an arbitrary angle
\(\theta\). Suppose that we choose the origin as the center of the rotation, so
we can compute the rotated vector as shown in~\eqref{eq:rotatedvector}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:rotatedvector}
	\begin{cases}
		x_1 = x_0\cos\theta - y_0\sin\theta\\
		y_1 = x_0\sin\theta + y_0\cos\theta
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
