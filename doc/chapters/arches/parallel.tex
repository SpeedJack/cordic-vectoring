\section{Parallel}\label{sec:parallel}
This architecture cames out from the "unrolling" of the word-serial
architecture. The output of an iteration feed the next stage, and so on.
This architecture can achieve the throughput of a new result for each clock 
cycle, but the clock frequency cannot be so high becouse of the high amount of 
logic between input and output register
