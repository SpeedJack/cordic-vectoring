\section{Parallel}\label{sec:parallel}
This architecture cames out from the \enquote{unrolling} of the word-serial
architecture. The output of an iteration feed the next stage, and so on.

This architecture can achieve the throughput of a new result for each clock
cycle, but the clock frequency cannot be so high because of the high amount of
logic between input and output registers.

The block diagram of this architecture is similar to the one of the pipelined
architecture, discussed below. The only difference is that no register is placed
between each stage.
