\section{Pipelined}\label{sec:pipelined}
This architecture is an improvement of the Parallel architecture. It is obtained
by inserting pipeline registers after each stage.
The improvements in using a pipelined architecture are clear, higher clock
frequency thanks to reduced amount of logic between two registers and an high
throughput, in fact this architecture make possible to have, after the pipeline
is filled, one result for each clock cycle. Thus is particularly suitable
for systems that need to process continuous streams of data.
