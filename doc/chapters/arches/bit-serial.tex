\section{Iterative bit-serial}\label{sec:bitserial}
This architecture is particularly suitable for extremely area constrained
applications. In \ref{bit-serial-diagram} is shown the bit-serial architecture
block diagram.

The inputs are stored in parallel into shift registers, the data shifts to the
right and goes to the adder the cordic algorithm is performed bitwise
