\chapter{Test plan}\label{ch:test}

For the verification of the correctness of our implementation of
\cordic{} is to write a \matlab{} model of the algorithm and then compare the
output to the VHDL one.

To run the tests described below, do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Open \code{matlab/Cordic.prj} in \matlab;
	\item Run \code{cordic\_float} to execute the floating point model
		described in \secref{sec:float};
	\item Run \code{cordic\_quantized} to execute the quantized model
		described in \secref{sec:quantized} and generate input files for
		the \modelsim{} testbench;
	\item Open \code{CORDIC/Modelsim/CORDIC.mpf} in \modelsim;
	\item Compile and run the simulation (testbench file:
		\code{cordic\_tb.vhd});
	\item Get back to \matlab{} and run \code{VHDL\_output\_verification},
		then you can check the various computed values and errors in the
		\matlab{} workspace.
\end{enumerate}

Note that, in the following, only the most important \matlab{} scripts are
shown. The full \matlab{} scripts set is available as attachment to this
document.
