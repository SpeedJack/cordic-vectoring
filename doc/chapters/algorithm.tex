\cordic{} (\standout{CO}ordinate \standout{R}otation \standout{DI}gital
\standout{C}omputer), known also as Volder's algorithm is a simple and
hardware-efficient iterative algorithm used to compute a wide range of
elementary, trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.

It was conceived by Jack E.\ Volder in 1956 as an accurate and performing
real-time digital replacement for B-58 Bomber's analog resolver.

\cordic{} idea is to translate complex operations in vectors' rotations that can
be efficiently implemented in hardware as shift and add operations.
